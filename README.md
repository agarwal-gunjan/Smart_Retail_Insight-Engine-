Predicting Daily Revenue & Classifying High vs Low Sales Days Using Machine Learning
Overview

Retailers often struggle with unpredictable revenue and uncertain demand patterns.
This project builds a dual-model AI system that:

i. Predicts daily revenue using historical sales data.

ii. Classifies each day as a High-Sales or Low-Sales Day based on revenue patterns.

The goal is to help businesses plan operations, inventory, workforce, and marketing more efficiently.
